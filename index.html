			<h1>Hey fashionistas, I am Margaux!</h1>
			<img src="images/profile.jpg" class="img-circle" width="200px">
			<p>As a student at IESEG, School of Management, in Digital Marketing, I created Beyond Retro with three friends in order to reduce the consumption of fast fashion and to make consumers buy less, but better. Indeed, I put at the heart of my concerns the respect of the environment and the preservation of the planet. I am also committed to supporting small local producers, sustainable brands and thrift shops. </p>

			<h2>My background</h2>
			<img src="images/Finland.jpg" width="200px">
			<p>After graduating with honors, I entered IESEG. I went to Finland as an exchange student during my third year, in order to improve my English and to develop my adaptation skills. </p>

			<h2>Fashion</h2>
			<img src="images/fashion.jpg" width="200px" alt="Margaux Guinard">
			<p>I have been passionate about fashion since I was young. I am always on the lookout for new trends. Fashion is not only superficial, it is also art. A garment is much more than a piece of fabric, it is a process, an association of materials, colors, shapes, reliefs. An outfit, a garment, an association of color says a lot about a person. We express our personality, our past, our ideals and our aspirations through the way we dress. We can send strong messages through our style. </p>

			<h2>My engagement</h2>
			<img src="images/engagement3.jpg" width="200px">
			<p>Fast fashion, this disposable and replaceable fashion affects us all. It creates not a need but a desire every two seconds. One day, while watching the report "the underbelly of low cost fashion", I had a trigger. I wanted to bring some sense back into my daily life by understanding better the reality behind a price, for example. Changing one's way of consuming does not happen overnight. But participating in a more sustainable fashion with Beyond Retro is the first step to engage in slow fashion.</p>
